* Micha's idea: 
  * Have the Kinect recognize different profiles like it actually does with Xbox 360 games.
  * Generate unique melodies for each new person.
  * Play the person's melody while they are in frame.

* Play different melodic figures depending on whether different areas of the grid are occupied, and/or how close objects in each area of the field are to the Kinect.
  * Maybe instead of melodic figures, build up a Casio-style drum loop, part by part.
    * Maybe things farther away in different areas could be different parts of a drum loop, and things closer up in different areas could be those drum loops + other melodic/rhythm parts.
